 Here are the steps involed in the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: `math`, `numpy`, and `cv2`.
2. Define a `ShapeDetector` class.
3. Initialize class attributes: `scale`, `cap` (video capture), and `out` (video writer).
4. Define a `detect_shape` method within the class.
5. Approximate the polygonal curve of a contour using `cv2.approxPolyDP`.
6. Filter out small contours and non-convex contours.
7. Identify shapes based on the number of vertices in the approximated contour:
    - For triangles, return "Triangle."
    - For quadrilaterals, further distinguish between rectangles and squares based on aspect ratio.
    - For other cases, identify circles based on aspect ratio and area.
8. Define a `process_video` method within the class.
9. Enter a loop to process video frames while the capture is open.
10. Read a frame from the video capture.
11. Resize the frame, convert it to grayscale, and apply Canny edge detection.
12. Find contours in the processed frame.
13. Iterate through contours and detect shapes using the `detect_shape` method.
14. If a shape is detected, draw the shape name on the original frame.
15. Display the frame with shape names.
16. Break the loop if the 'q' key is pressed.
17. Release the video capture object and close all OpenCV windows.
18. Define the entry point of the script.
19. Create an instance of `ShapeDetector` and process the video.
